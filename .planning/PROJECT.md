# Willemilk Portfolio

## What This Is

A Next.js portfolio and Linktree site for Willem with an authentic 2010s-2020s DeviantArt sparkledog/scene kid aesthetic. Features three pages (Home, About, Cool Stuff) showcasing social media links and coding projects, styled with maximum nostalgia chaos - rainbow gradients, neon colors, checkerboards, glitter effects, star brushes, and early internet energy. Built for performance with CSS-only animations.

## Core Value

The aesthetic must be authentically chaotic - if it doesn't feel like a 2010s DeviantArt profile or scene kid MySpace page with "Welcome to my profile" energy, it's not right. Sensory overload that's still navigable.

### Out of Scope

- **CMS or admin panel** — Content is hardcoded and rarely updated
- **Sound effects** — Mentioned as optional but not implementing for accessibility/UX
- **Sparkledog rainbow gradient aesthetic focus** — Prioritizing scene/emo + early YouTube vibe instead
- **Backend API or database** — Static site only
- **User authentication** — No login system needed
- **Blog or dynamic content** — Static pages only
- **Heavy animation libraries** — CSS-only for performance

## Context

Willem is an MBO Software Development student who wants a personal portfolio site that reflects their personality and nostalgia for 2010s internet culture. The site serves as both a Linktree-style link aggregator and a project showcase, styled with the chaotic, colorful energy of DeviantArt sparkledog profiles, scene/emo MySpace pages, and early YouTube aesthetics.

The aesthetic is intentionally maximalist and nostalgic, referencing:
- DeviantArt OC culture (sparkledogs, rainbow everything, glitter)
- Scene/emo subculture (checkerboards, neon colors, Rawr XD energy)
- Early 2010s internet (star brushes, Comic Sans, "Welcome to my profile")

Despite the chaotic aesthetic, the site must remain functional and performant - users should be able to find links and navigate easily.

## Constraints

- **Performance**: CSS animations only, no heavy JavaScript animation libraries - site must load fast and animate smoothly
- **Deployment**: Must deploy to Vercel without configuration issues
- **Aesthetic fidelity**: Must authentically capture 2010s scene kid/DeviantArt vibe - this is non-negotiable
- **Maintenance**: Content is hardcoded, updates will be infrequent
- **Mobile**: Full aesthetic experience on mobile devices (same chaos energy, no toning down)

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Next.js 15 + TypeScript | Modern, type-safe, Vercel-optimized, best practices | — Pending |
| CSS-only animations | Performance requirement, avoid heavy libraries while maintaining chaos | — Pending |
| Hardcoded content | Rarely updated, no need for CMS complexity | — Pending |
| Full mobile chaos | Aesthetic is core value, don't compromise on smaller screens | — Pending |
